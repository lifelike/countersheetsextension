Countersheets Extension for Inkscape
========================================

Inkscape extension for the layout of sheets of cards, tiles, or counters
for boardgames.

Since the extension was originally created for wargame counters, the
generated images are refered to as counters,
except in examples explicitly about making something else (like sheets
of cards). There is very little in the tool that is specific to
counters though, or to board games. It can be used as a
generic templating tool (mail merge or data merge).

Features
--------

* Two-sided counters with back of sheets properly mirrored.
* Templates for counters to generate drawn in Inkscape.
* Use Comma Separated Values (CSV) files for describing what counters to make.
* First column in the CSV says how many of each counter to make.
* Several templates can be combined to make up a single counter.
* Automatically make as many sheets needed to fit all counters.
* Replace text strings and bitmap images for each counter.
* Toggle specified parts of counters on or off for each couter.
* Set colors and other attributes of (parts of) counters.
* Any counters can be mixed on the same sheet (even different sizes).
* Registration marks for manual cutting of the sheets.
* Bleed around counters.
* Simple text mark-up for bold and italics text styles and inlined images.
* Decide exactly where on a sheet to put blocks of counters, for die cutting.
* Export created sheets to PNG or PDF.
* Export individual counters to PNG images.

Installation
------------

You need Inkscape 1.1.1 installed. Other versions may or may not work, but
are not officially supported. If you are using an older
version of Inkscape get one of the older versions of this
extension instead (like [this one](https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension/releases/tag/2.2hex1)).

Copy countersheet.py, and countersheet.inx to where Inkscape
looks for extensions. On my Mac and Linux computers this is in
.config/inkscape/extensions.  In Windows it will be something like
C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions.

After you (re)start Inkscape you should find "Create Countersheet"
in the "Boardgames" submenu of the "Extensions" menu.

See more complete instructions [on the wiki](https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension/wiki/Install).

Try Google or the Inkscape Guild on BoardGameGeek for help.

Getting Started
---------------

You need a SVG file with template objects open in Inkscape, and
a CSV data file with information about what to generate. Run
the Create Countersheet extension and provide the name of
the data file (the other options in the dialog window you can
ignore for now).

See the [wiki](https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension/wiki/) for more.
